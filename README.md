# 🚧 Fit-Track 2.0 — *Project In Progress*
AI-Powered Nutrition & Food Recognition System

Fit-Track 2.0 is an AI-driven food recognition and nutrition tracking system that detects food items from images, calculates calories and macro–micro nutrients, and provides personalized diet recommendations.  
Built using **YOLOv8, Flask, SQLite, and Ollama (Gemma-2B)**, the system delivers real-time dietary insights with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Food Recognition (YOLOv8):** Detects multiple dishes from a single image.
- **Nutrition Estimation:** Calculates calories, macros, and micronutrients using curated datasets.
- **AI Nutrition Insights:** Uses Ollama (Gemma-2B) to generate health benefits and nutritional explanations.
- **Personalized Diet Recommendations:** Suggests meals based on user health goals.
- **Progress Tracking:** Logs meals and tracks calorie and nutrient trends.
- **Lightweight Backend:** Developed using Flask + SQLite for quick integration.
